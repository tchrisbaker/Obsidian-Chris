Unless there is a prohibition imposed by affordability covenants or other restrictions

applicable to the Premises, we require all residents to continuously maintain a policy of

liability insurance in an amount no less than $100,000 per occurrence issued by an

authorized insurance company. You must furnish proof of insurance to us on or before

commencement date of your Lease and, you must continue to provide evidence of coverage for

all subsequent renewal terms. You can obtain such insurance through an insurance agent of

your choice. You must name the Property as an Interested Party under your policy. Except

where prohibited by law, if you fail to obtain and maintain liability insurance as required

by this paragraph, you will be in violation of your lease obligations. In such event, we

will send a written notice to you demanding that you cure the violation by procuring the

insurance and supplying evidence of coverage to us. If you fail to supply evidence of such

insurance coverage to us on or before the cancellation date or expiration date of your

renter's insurance or liability policy, we reserve the right to procure liability insurance

coverage for our protection, on your behalf, and to charge you an administrative fee of $35.

00 per month, which is inclusive of the premium paid, until you provide us with proof of

current liability insurance. You agree that this administrative fee is a liquidated damages

provision and that such amount is a fair and reasonable estimate of the administrative costs

we will incur as a result of procuring the liability insurance coverage to protect our

asset. The premium payment made by us, and the administrative fee we charge to procure the

insurance, will be considered additional rent. If you fail to pay for the liability

insurance and/or allow the expiration or cancellation of any liability insurance policy

during your tenancy, without substitute insurance being put in place, this will be

considered a default under the Lease.
