Dev: AD Section (SH) Staging - Processing

The following is ready for Tech Review  

-   Updated the code so that if the section name changes and the Section IsDeleted\_\_c == false then the Task Sections related to it will have their Name changed to match the Section Name and the Full Section Name will match the Section's Full Section Name (it only is updated if the Section is not deleted and the relalated Tasks are not Completed and not Canceled
-   The Section Name on  Section Staging object  and Task Section Name on  Task Section Staging object are now 1024 Text Area Long fields. The Section Staging records will populate the Full Section Name with the full name even if it's greater than 80 characters and the regular Name field on Section will be limited to 80 characters

```Java
taskSectionStagingRecs.add(new SH_Task_Section_Staging__c(
    Task_Section_Name__c = sectionStagingRecord.Section_Name__c,
        AD_Section_ID__c = taskSection.AD_Section_SH__r.AD_Section_ID__c,
        AD_Task_ID__c = taskSection.AD_Task__r.AD_Task_ID__c,
        Action__c = 'Add',
        SH_Section_Staging__c = sectionStagingRecord.Id,
        Status__c = SH_Constants.STAGING_SYNC_QUEUE,
        Source_Timestamp__c = sectionStagingRecord.Source_Timestamp__c
));
```


```Java
taskSectionStagingRecsToInsert.add(new SH_Task_Section_Staging__c(
        AD_Section_ID__c = taskSection.AD_Section_SH__r.AD_Section_ID__c,
        AD_Task_ID__c = taskSection.AD_Task__r.AD_Task_ID__c,
        Action__c = 'Remove',
        SH_Section_Staging__c = sectionStagingRecord.Id,
        Status__c = SH_Constants.STAGING_SYNC_QUEUE,
        Source_Timestamp__c = sectionStagingRecord.Source_Timestamp__c
));          
```


-   When the Section is deleted, it creates a new Task Section Staging record to tell it to Remove. The Source timestamp of the created Task Section Staging record should be the same as original section staging record.  The same should be done for when a Section is renamed and Task Section Staging records are created  
    -   ​Currently there is a Section\_Deleted\_\_c boolean flag to determine if it came from the Section API and not the Task API. Instead, it should  use a lookup from the Task Secton Staging record up to the Section Staging​. This will give us information on where the Task Section Staging record came from as well as let the Task Section Staging code know whether it came from the Section API or Task API
